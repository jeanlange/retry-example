## WhatIs
This repo is a worked example of using http://caolan.github.io/async/'s `retry` function. I needed to pull it out into a self-contained problem when I couldn't figure it out in a larger context. Since examples were difficult for me to find, I figured I'd publish this one.

Open `file.html` in your favorite modern browser, then open the console and refresh to see what's going on. `file.html` is full of commentary.
